Hi, I’m Rohith Vasam 👋  
Senior SDET | Test Automation Engineer

I design and build **reliable test automation systems** for web, API, and mobile platforms, with a focus on **validating real business behavior rather than UI mechanics**. My work emphasizes deterministic execution, maintainable frameworks, and CI-ready automation.
